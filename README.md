## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS positioning


### What I learned

Building this project helped me practice more on CSS flexbox, how to determine the flex-direction of elements, also centering an element using <code>margin: auto;</code>. This also helped me understand the sligt difference between absolute and relative positions.


If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

Although I used the CSS positions to center the divs, I intend to also do that with the flexbox property, so I intend to learn more about the CSS flexbox property to do this easily.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://youtu.be/-Wlt8NRtOpo) - This is an amazing tutorial on css flexbox which helped me finally understand the flexbox property. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
